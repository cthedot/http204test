<title>204 AJAX test</title>
<body>
    <p>Client request to Server which responds with 204 and NO CONTENT in body
        but wrong Content-length: 2 header
    </p>
    <p>Expected: 204 MUST NOT have content and request finishes despite wrong 
        Content-Length. Works like this in Firefox. Edge seems to wait forever
        and runs into set timeout
    </p>
    <button id="go">Request from API</button>
    <pre id="out">loading</pre>
